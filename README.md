# A3SimpleModManager

Development in progress - NOT a finished tool yet!

When feature complete this tool will allow the generation of a repo.json file on the server, which will contain all the mods in use + the hashes of each file in the mod. There will then be a WPF app which checks against this .json file and the user's local mods to ensure that they have the same versions as the server.

At the moment only the repo.json generation project is complete.
